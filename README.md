Development is now private.

For a Season 20 compatible version, you can contact me on discord: pulse1986 price is $100

It comes with all the premium plugins that many sell, and the default realmuv2 template, the support for bug fixes will be provided.

Each new season update will be paid 60$

The cms has no license system so your free to use on any server.

It is open source so sharing with others is on your conscience, but if you want good working relationships i would suggest not sharing or reselling it.

I accept only crypto payments.
